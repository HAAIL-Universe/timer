# Timer Frontend Environment Configuration
# This file is a template for environment variables used by Vite at build time.
# Copy this to .env (or .env.local for development) and customize values as needed.

# API Base URL
# The backend API endpoint that the timer app will communicate with.
# 
# - Value is read at BUILD time (not runtime) by Vite.
# - Must be prefixed with VITE_ for Vite to expose it to the browser via import.meta.env.
# - Default: http://localhost:3000 (matches dev server proxy target)
# - For production: set to your actual API server URL
# - During development: the Vite proxy (vite.config.js) rewrites /api requests to this URL
#
# Examples:
#   http://localhost:3000          (default, local backend on port 3000)
#   http://localhost:8000          (local backend on port 8000)
#   https://api.example.com        (production)
#   https://api.staging.example.com (staging)
#
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Notes on Vite environment variables:
# 1. Only variables prefixed with VITE_ are exposed to the browser code.
# 2. These are embedded at build time (npm run build), not at runtime.
# 3. For development (npm run dev), Vite reads .env and .env.local in this order:
#    - .env (shared, checked into git)
#    - .env.local (local overrides, NOT checked into git)
# 4. To override during dev: create .env.local with your custom values.
# 5. Access in code: import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL
